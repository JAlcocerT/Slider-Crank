# Slider-Crank

Visual representation of a slider-crank Position given: the crank, connecting rod and offset dimensions.

Deployed at <https://slider-crank.fossengineer.com>

## Features

* Graphs:
    * Mechanism Animation
    * Piston Position Evolution vs Crank Angle
* Additional info:
    * Range of motion of the piston (not intuitive with offsets >0)
    * Intake/Combustion vs Compression/Exhaust stroke's crank degrees (again, not intuitive when offset >0)

### Work in Progress

* Con-Rod angle evolution and angle range
* When is the mechanism getting *bloqued*? - Spotting non compatible ranges of motions
* Velocities with Point Reference Approach
* Acelerations with Point Reference Approach
